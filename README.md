# Decision Support System for Comprehensive Analysis of the Financial Market
_**2024 Master**_

**The purpose** of the work is to develop a decision support system for comprehensive
financial market analysis. 

**The primary objective** of the system is to provide an accurate forecast
of the dynamics of financial sectors and their industries, as well as price changes for assets based
on the analysis of historical data using modern machine learning methods and models.

**The novelty** of the work lies in considering entropy as a measure of uncertainty in
financial market processes for forecasting and enabling the aggregation of the results at sector or
industry level to identify general trends.
